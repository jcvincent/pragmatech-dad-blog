A few seconds says “hello.”  
10 seconds begins to melt stress.  
20 seconds—science proves your heart rate lowers and peace returns.  
2 minutes and you both start to exhale, really exhale.  
4 minutes? Sometimes your heartbeats actually sync. Your nervous system resets. Your souls remember they’re safe with each other.  
  
Marriage is reinforced in the quiet rhythms: the way you choose to hold on, not rush away.  
  
So next time you embrace—stay.  
Stay long enough for your body to calm.  
Stay long enough for both you and your husband to feel anchored.  
Stay long enough to remember you’re on the same team.  
  
Because sometimes… the hug says more than words ever could.
