Obsidian AI Tutorial: Automate note-taking with AI agents. Complete setup guide for Apple Notes migration to Obsidian + Cursor AI integration.

The Problem: I was drowning in thousands of scattered Apple Notes, spending every weekend organizing instead of creating. 

The Solution: I discovered how to build an AI agent that manages my entire knowledge system automatically.

In this video, I'll show you exactly how I:

‚Üí Exported all my Apple Notes to Obsidian in one click

‚Üí Used AI to organize 2,000+ notes in under 30 seconds  

‚Üí Created 847 new connections I never would have found

‚Üí Built an agent that files notes and drafts my weekly status

‚Üí Got my Sundays (and sanity) back

üõ†Ô∏è TOOLS MENTIONED:

‚Ä¢ Obsidian (Free): [https://obsidian.md]

‚Ä¢ Those who spend too much time organizing vs. creating

üí° KEY TAKEAWAYS:

‚Ä¢ Your note system should work for you, not against you

‚Ä¢ AI can handle organization while you focus on thinking

‚Ä¢ 10-minute setup can save you hours every week

‚Ä¢ Start simple - even just the filing step is game-changing


Prompts used:

```
You're my knowledge management assistant. 
Please analyze my Obsidian Vault structure and note-taking patterns. 
Tell me what you observe about how I organize information.
```

```
Base on the PARA method, suggest where each unfiled notes should go.  
Consider:  
- Projects = active, has an end date  
- Areas = ongoing responsibilities  
- Resources = future reference  
- Archive = no longer active  
Show me your reasoning before taking action.
```

```
Find all potential connections between notes. 
Create bidirectional links using [[Note Name]] format. 
Focus on conceptual connections, not just keyword matches.
```


```
You've read all my notes, my challenges, my thinking patterns, my goals. 
If you were an executive coach specifically focused on <<specific topic>>, 
what questions would you ask me?
