7 ways I had to change to stay fit for my children:
 
1. I had to schedule my workouts into my calendar to get them done. 
2. I needed to hire a meal prep delivery service, or I’d always order from UberEats. 
3. I include them in my workouts to show them that Daddy takes care of himself. 
4. I take walks with my kids to get my steps in. 
5. I had to keep junk out of the house and replace it with healthy items like fruits and veggies. 
6. I had to work out more in my home gym to cut the time it takes to travel to the gym. 
7. I needed to cut my excuses about lack of time and being “too busy” and just get better at time management. 
 
Not gonna lie. The game changes when you have kids, but that ain’t no excuse to take the foot off the gas pedal. 
 
Your family needs you to be healthy. Are you willing to make the effort?
